IAMMETER-Central is a versatile middleware platform designed to simplify energy monitoring and management.

Unlike traditional solutions, it provides a robust set of APIs that handle user management, device integration, and data storage, making it easier than ever to create a tailored energy management system. With IAMMETER-Central, you can deploy the system on your own server, granting full control over how your data is processed and displayed.

This platform focuses solely on the backend, offering API interfaces and a straightforward device management UI. By excluding business logic and pre-defined frontends, IAMMETER-Central allows developers to design their own user-facing applications. You can customize the interface, integrate it into existing workflows, or build entirely new monitoring dashboardsâ€”without the need to reinvent the backend processes.

Moreover, IAMMETER-Central supports widely-used databases like MySQL and MariaDB. Deployment is flexible: run it directly with dotnet commands or set it up in a Docker container. Once installed, you can import device data, configure database connections, and begin developing a fully customized energy monitoring solution.

For those seeking to control their energy usage more effectively or build a unique monitoring platform, IAMMETER-Central provides a powerful, flexible foundation.
